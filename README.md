## 🪐 XANDEUM.OS — Unified Command Suite
The definitive pNode analytics engine for the Deep South Era. XANDEUM.OS is a high-performance monitoring platform built for the next generation of Xandeum storage providers. It bridges the gap between Raw pRPC Metadata and Economic Strategy, providing stakers and operators with real-time visibility into the Xandeum storage layer.

🚀 Key Innovations
1. Live Topology Radar
Unlike static lists, our Integrated Orbital Radar visualizes the geographic and network distribution of pNodes. It tracks gossip propagation across the network, allowing users to inspect node health via a spatial interface.

2. Deep South STOINC Predictor
A built-in economic forecaster that calculates Projected Epoch Rewards. It accounts for:

Base Era Boost: 16x (Deep South Phase)

NFT Multipliers: Titan (11x), Dragon (4x), and Coyote (2.5x)

Wiz Score: Real-time performance weighting.

3. Herrenberg Release Intelligence (v0.8.0)
Full compatibility with the latest Xandeum software. The dashboard automatically flags legacy Munich nodes and prioritizes Herrenberg adoption metrics to ensure network-wide stability.

4. Professional Analytics Table
A high-scannability registry featuring:

Verified Storage Depth: Monitoring PB-scale data redundancy.

Uptime Diagnostics: Real-time status tracking via pRPC gossip sync.

Version Filtering: Quick-search by node ID, region, or release version.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)

Styling: Custom CSS-in-JS for Zero-Runtime overhead.

Data Sync: Simulated pRPC Gossip Layer with 30s Heartbeat.

Deployment: Vercel (Edge Network Optimized).
